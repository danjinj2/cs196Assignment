    <p>This text provides a thorough introduction to “modern” or “abstract” algebra
at a level suitable for upper-level undergraduates and beginning graduate
students.</p>
    <p>The book addresses the conventional topics: groups, rings, fields, and
linear algebra, with symmetry as a unifying theme. This subject matter is
central and ubiquitous in modern mathematics and in applications ranging
from quantum physics to digital communications</p>
